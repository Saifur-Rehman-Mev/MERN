🧭 About This Repository
This repository is part of my learning journey in full-stack web development 🚀. I actively practice and experiment with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) along with modern tools like TypeScript and Prisma ⚙️.
Here, you’ll find my practice code, mini-projects, notes, and random experiments 💻. The goal is simple: learn consistently, build real things, and improve every day 🌱.
Feel free to explore, star ⭐ the repo, or suggest improvements — I’m always open to learning more ✨
